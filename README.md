# OpenDirectoryUtils

This Gem allows one to build or send pre-built commands to control
(common OD and LDAP attributes) on an OpenDirectory server.

One can also build custom DSCL commands and send them to the server as needed too.

## Change Log

* **v0.1.4** - 2018-06-13 - changed the return hash to {response: xxx, status: 'success'}
* **v0.1.3** - 2018-06-13 - able to sync all fields in typcial OD
- refactored results code (ssh_cmds have redacted passwords)
- finished adding pre-built od commands for users - good for syncing accounts
* **v0.1.2** - 2018-06-09 - all user creation features enabled
- user creation will add user to a group if group_name present
- new accounts disabled by default (w/ option to enable on creation)
- now repo includes example code (to create accounts)
* **v0.1.1** - 2018-06-06
- refactored to separate OD attribute from LDAP attribute commands (shortened methods and better organization and shorter tests)
* **v0.1.0** - 2018-06-06
  - can adjust and delete OD attributes for users and groups (pre-built ldap attributes comming soon)

## ToDo

* Do not return dir admin password with command on errors
* LDAP attributes (so las can sync accounts easily)
* Refactor Process Results
* Test direct commands
* Check Connection Unit Tests
* verify which email address is LDAP (& seen in GUI)

              }
# create a user
od.run( command: :user_create,  params: user_params )

# update user's record (all dscl and ldap fields are available)

# fix spelling of first name
od.run( command: :user_set_first_name,
        params: {user_name: 'someone', first_name: 'John'} )

# get user's record
od.run( command: :user_info,  params: user_params )

# create a group
od.run( command: :group_create_full, params: group_params )

# add the first user to the group
od.run( command: :group_add_first_user,
        params: {user_name: 'someone', group_name: 'agroup'} )
# add additional user to the group
od.run( command: :user_append_to_group,
        params: {user_name: 'existinguser', group_name: 'agroup'} )

# get group record and members inf
od.run( command: :group_info,  params: user_params )

# remove a user from a group
od.run( command: :user_remove_from_group,
        params: {user_name: 'someone', group_name: 'agroup'})
od.run( command: :user_remove_from_group,
